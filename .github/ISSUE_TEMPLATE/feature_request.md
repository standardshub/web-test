## Summary

<!-- Provide a summary of the feature here -->

Validating HTML in CI.

## Expected Behavior

<!-- What is your expectation? Tell us what should happen -->

When a PR is created, the CI should validate the generated HTML files under
`_site`, and exit with non-zero status so that PR author will be notified
before merging.

## Requirements and rationales

<!-- What must be implemented in the feature, and why? -->

The implementation MUST validate the files that we own, including the content
pages, local CSS modifications, and template files under `_layouts` because we
do not want to publish invalid HTML and CSS.

## Context

<!--- Why do you need the feature? Tell us which problem you are trying to
solve. -->

I would like to ensure the HTML and CSS are valid to prevent invalid code from
getting deployed to the production. It would be nice if the CI validates all
HTML and CSS files generated by `jekyll` are valid so that the rule is
enforced to every commit.
