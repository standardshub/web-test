# Demo site for static site on AWS S3

## Requirements

- AWS account
- GitHub account
- Optionally, a domain name

## Architecture overview

GitHub Actions builds jekyll site in its build environment when a condition
meets pre-defined criteria. The site content, then, is transferred to S3.

An S3 bucket is configured so that it serves the contents to public.

The deployment is completely automated.

### Pros

- You can use ruby jekyll plugins in the build process, which `gh-pages` does
  not allow
- You do not need EC2 instance to serve your content (no administration cost)
- S3 is far cheaper than EC2 instance (see [the pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/))
- S3 scales automatically (more than you probably need)

### Cons

- No dynamic content (JavaScript is only your friend)
- No database (all you have is static files)
- No programming language is available (no ruby, no nothing)

## Implementation

The GitHub repository keeps all the contents and Jekyll installation. Nothing
new here.

A GitHub Workflow, `deploy-s3.yml`, is defined under
[.github/workflows](https://github.com/trombik/jekyll-site-demo-starhub/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml).
This action is triggered when something is pushed (or merged) to `devel`
branch.  When triggered, the workflow does:

- checkout the branch
- set necessary AWS credential in the build environment
- install ruby in the build environment
- install gems using `bundler`
- build the jekyll site
- copy the site contents under `_site` to specified AWS S3 bucket

The S3 bucket is configured (manually, not included in the repository) so that
the bucket does:

- allows anyone to access to files in the bucket
- serve files as if it is a web server

By default, S3 creates a unique domain name for buckets, which means you do
not need a dedicated domain name for the site.

If you want to use your own domain name for the site, you can do so by using
[Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) (additional configrations are
required).

If you want to restrcit access to a certain group of people, you can do so by
using
[Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html)
(requires additional cost).
[serverless_static_website_with_basic_auth](https://github.com/dumrauf/serverless_static_website_with_basic_auth)
is an implementation. Depending on your requirements, you also need TLS
protection.

## Customization

This repository is a demo repository. The GitHub Actions is disabled. To
deploy your own content on _your_ S3, you need to:

- fork this repository
- create a branch `devel`
- modify the content
- create a bucket in _your_ S3
- configure the bucket so that it serves the files in the bucket (see
  [how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html))
- create an IAM role for the deployment (see [deploy-s3-bucket-policy.json](https://github.com/trombik/jekyll-site-demo-starhub/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-s3-bucket-policy.json))
- create an IAM user to deploy in _your_ AWS console and assign the role to
  the user
- add _Secrets_ (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) to _your_
  repository (see [how](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets))
- replace the bucket name in `deploy-s3.yml` with _your_ bucket name
- enable GitHub Actions in _your_ repository
- push your changes to `devel` branch

After these steps, whenever you push something to `devel` branch, the Jekyll
site is deployed to S3 automatically.
